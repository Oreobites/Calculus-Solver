# Calculus-Solver
First team project in dimigo.

## How to use
You can enter functions, including polynomial functions, exponential functions, and trigonometric functions(sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot).

There are some rules for the input you make:


**1. Polynomial Function**
 
  * Implemented by 이장근(Gleeeee). Everything concerning polynomial functions is in charge of him.

  * You should make an input like this: `5x^4+3x^2+2x^1`
 
 
**2. Exponential Function**
 
  * Implemented by 이지훈(EasyHoon). Everything concerning exponential functions is in charge of him.
 
  * You should make an input like this: `5*e^x or 2^x`
 
 
**3. Trigonometric Function**
 
  * Implemented by 이건호(CatNote). Everything concerning trigonometric functions is in charge of him.
 
  * You should make an input like this: `3*sinx+5*cotx`
 
 

**4. Overall Management, GUI**
 
  * Implemented by 박규남(Oreobites). Everything concerning UI, graphs and interlocking files is in charge of him.
 
  * You can submit bug reports directly to @Oreobites.
